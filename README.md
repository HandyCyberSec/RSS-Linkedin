# RSS Linkedin

This Python script allows you to post company updates to LinkedIn using the LinkedIn API. It fetches content from an RSS feed and creates a formatted post for your LinkedIn company page.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, you'll need:

1. LinkedIn API Access Token: Obtain an access token from LinkedIn's Developer Console.

2. Company Page ID: Identify the ID of the LinkedIn company page where you want to post updates.

3. RSS Feed URL: Provide the URL of the RSS feed containing the content you want to post.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script `post_linkedin_update.py`.

2. Open the script in a text editor and replace the placeholders with your actual credentials:

   ```python
   access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
   company_id = 'YOUR_COMPANY_ID'
   rss_feed_url = 'URL_TO_YOUR_RSS_FEED'
   ```

3. Run the script manually:
   
   ```sh
   python post_linkedin_update.py
   ```

4. Optionally, set up a scheduled task to run the script periodically for automatic updates.

## Customization

- You can adjust the formatting of the LinkedIn post by modifying the `update_text` variable in the script.
- Review LinkedIn's API documentation for any specific guidelines regarding content formatting.

## Important Notes

- This script is provided as-is and may require further customization based on your needs.
- Always adhere to LinkedIn's API usage policies and guidelines.
- Remember to keep your LinkedIn API credentials secure.
